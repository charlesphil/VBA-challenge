# VBA-Challenge: Charles Phil Week 2 homework

## Note before grading

For this project, I have a copy of the "Instructions" folder from the course GitLab and a separate "Testing" folder where I stored a copy of the "alphabetical_testing.xlsm" file along with a "work_in_progress.vb" file. Please do not use these files for grading. I have left these folders in instead of adding them to a .gitignore in case I had issues accessing the instructions and my work across different computers over the holidays.

## Where to access the files

To access the files to grade, open the "Grade_Me" folder.

![Where to find files](Images/where_to_find.png)

Inside the folder, you will find a copy of the Visual Basic script saved as "completed_script.vb". The "Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm" file is a copy of the stock data file from the Instructions, but changed from xlsx to xlsm to be able to run my script on the file. Along with the .vb and .xlsm files, you will find the required screenshots of the results for each year in the "Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm" file.
